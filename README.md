# Word of the Day

## About
I built this site for fun to make my version of Wordle for my students. When I teach them about the binary search algorithm, we go over how to look up a word if all the words are sorted alphabetically - and that's what this game does! You can read my write up on building this site on [dev.to](https://dev.to/ryanjames1729/building-a-word-game-lets-play-alpha-234p)

## Using the Site
You can visit [Let's Play Alpha!](https://lets-play-alpha.netlify.app) to get started. The app gives you a getting started modal when it launches. In each round of the game you get 5 guesses. The incorrect guesses are sorted alphabetically to help you narrow down your guesses. Correct letters are highlighted green to let you know that the correct letter is in the correct spot. Once you solve the puzzle for more than 1 consecutive day, you can start a streak.

## Tech Stack
I built this site using [Astro](https://astro.build), a React component on the client side, [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) for CSS, and I deployed the site with [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
